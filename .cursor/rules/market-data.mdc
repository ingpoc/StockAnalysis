# Market Data Guidelines

## Purpose
This rule provides guidance on the implementation, processing, and management of market data in the StockAnalysis application.

## Key Principles
- ✓ Define comprehensive market data models for indices and sectors
- ✓ Implement market data services for retrieving and updating information
- ✓ Use consistent API endpoints for accessing market data
- ✓ Follow the file organization structure for all market-related files
- ✓ Update and cache market data efficiently

## Data Structures
```python
class MarketData(BaseModel):
    date: datetime
    indices: Dict[str, IndexData]
    sectors: Dict[str, SectorData]
    top_gainers: List[StockSummary]
    top_losers: List[StockSummary]
    most_active: List[StockSummary]
```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/market/data` - Get latest market data
- `GET /api/v1/market/data/{date}` - Get market data by date
- `GET /api/v1/market/indices` - Get all indices
- `GET /api/v1/market/sectors` - Get all sectors

## File Organization
- ✓ Models: `src/models/market.py`
- ✓ Services: `src/services/market_service.py`
- ✓ API endpoints: `src/api/endpoints/market.py`
- ✓ Tests: `tests/test_market.py`
- ✓ Utilities: `src/utils/market_utils.py`

## Data Processing
- ✓ Update market data at regular intervals
- ✓ Cache market data for quick access
- ✓ Format percentage values consistently
- ✓ Sort lists by appropriate metrics
- ✓ Handle missing data gracefully

## Error Handling
- ✓ Handle API rate limits for external data sources
- ✓ Log all data processing errors
- ✓ Provide meaningful error messages
- ✓ Return appropriate HTTP status codes

These guidelines ensure consistent handling of market data across the application.
