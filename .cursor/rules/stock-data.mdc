# Stock Data Guidelines

## Purpose
This rule provides guidance on the structure, processing, and management of stock data in the StockAnalysis application.

## Key Principles
- ✓ Define all stock models in the appropriate files with required fields
- ✓ Implement complete stock services for data retrieval and manipulation
- ✓ Use consistent API endpoints for accessing stock data
- ✓ Follow the file organization structure for all stock-related files
- ✓ Process stock data according to defined rules for consistency

## Data Structure
```python
class Stock(BaseModel):
    symbol: str
    company_name: str
    sector: str
    industry: str
    market_cap: float
    current_price: float
    financial_metrics: List[FinancialMetric]
```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/stock/{symbol}` - Get stock details
- `GET /api/v1/stock/{symbol}/metrics` - Get financial metrics
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/sector/{sector}` - Get stocks by sector

## File Organization
- ✓ Models: `src/models/stock.py`
- ✓ Services: `src/services/stock_service.py`
- ✓ API endpoints: `src/api/endpoints/stock.py`
- ✓ Tests: `tests/test_stock.py`
- ✓ Utilities: `src/utils/stock_utils.py`

## Data Processing Rules
- ✓ Validate stock symbols against a known list
- ✓ Format financial values appropriately
- ✓ Sort financial metrics by date (newest first)
- ✓ Cache frequently accessed stock data
- ✓ Update stock data at regular intervals
- ✓ Implement proper error handling for missing data

## Error Handling
- ✓ Return 404 for unknown stock symbols
- ✓ Handle API rate limits for external data sources
- ✓ Log all data processing errors
- ✓ Provide meaningful error messages

These guidelines ensure consistent handling of stock data across the application.
